# Distributed Systems Operator Interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![CI](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

- The Distributed system operator interface (DSOI) is a specification which focuses on building kubernetes operator's for distributed system's specifically big data systems like apache druid, apache pinot, presto.

- The spec defines standard practices and design pattern's which can help build k8s controllers for multiple node types. An example of nodeType can be a druid broker, a presto controller etc.

- DSOI covers most common deployments patterns in order to deploy and maintain heterogenous distributed system clusters.

- The DSOI spec follows standard kubernetes controller practices and adheres to the k8s API specification.

- The DSOI spec is not static and expects to evolve. Not bound to any specific application.

- DSOI spec consists of kubernetes native CRD's and spec's. The goal is not to re-introduce any new concepts but to encapsulate existing spec in a single structured spec.
